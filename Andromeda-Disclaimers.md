## Managed Account Disclaimers

### Generally
As with all investments, there are certain risks associated with the investment objectives being pursued by the Adviser on behalf of TACO Foundation (the “Client”) in the managed account(s) (the “Account”).  No guarantee or representation is made that the Client’s investment objectives will be successful.  The Client should be aware that the Account will change in value, and the Client could lose money by virtue of the Account’s investment objectives.  The Account Investments are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.  The Client should carefully consider the risks involved in determining whether the investment objectives of the Account is a suitable investment, including the risks discussed below.  The Client should consult its own legal, tax and financial advisers to determine whether it desires the Adviser to invest the assets of Account.

### Market Risk
The Account’s investments are subject to changes in general economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.  Investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity.  The Account is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and markets.  Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on the Account and the Account Investments.

### Debt Securities Risk
The values of debt securities may increase or decrease as a result of the following: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt securities markets.  To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply.  A rising interest rate environment may cause the value of the Account’s fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on the liquidity of the Account’s fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed income markets.  During periods when interest rates are at low levels, the Account’s yield can be low, and the Account may have a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis).  To the extent that interest rates fall, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster than originally anticipated.  If the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of principal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates.  During periods of falling interest rates, the income received by the Account may decline.  Changes in interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the values of debt securities of longer durations.  Returns on investments in debt securities could trail the returns on other investment options, including investments in equity securities.

### U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk
U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other fixed income securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics.  Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Account’s U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.

### Income Risk
The Account’s income may decline due to falling interest rates or other factors.  Issuers of securities held by the Account may call or redeem the securities during periods of falling interest rates, and the Account would likely be required to reinvest in securities paying lower interest rates.  If an obligation held by the Account is prepaid, the Account may have to reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying income at lower rates.

### Liquidity Risk
Lack of a ready market, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability of the Account to sell a security at an advantageous time or price or at all.  Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value.  Illiquidity of the Account’s holdings may also limit the ability of the Account to obtain cash to make distributions and withdrawals on a timely basis.  In addition, the Account, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid investments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such investments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain assets.

### Valuation Risk
Some portfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the Account’s investment portfolio, may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations.  This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity.  There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available.  The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations.  Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including “fair valued” securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used.  In addition, there is no assurance that the Account could sell or close out an Account Investment for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Account would incur a loss because an Account Investment is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the Account at that time.

## Prime Brokerage and Custodial Risks

### Dependence on Custodian(s) and Prime Brokers
The Adviser and the Client rely upon the Custodian for executing trades, holding and pricing securities, and processing transactions in the Account.  They also rely on the Prime Broker to provide services such as trade execution and cash management.  The failure of either the Custodian or Prime Broker to perform these functions accurately could result in significant financial losses in the Account.

### Custodian and Prime Broker Errors
Custodial and Prime Brokerage firms implement systems to in order to prevent errors, however, there is no guarantee that such systems will always work as intended.  Errors related to trade execution, settlement, pricing, record-keeping and other services can occur.

### Custodian and Prime Broker Insolvency
There is the risk that the Custodial and Prime Brokerage firms utilized by the Adviser and the Client in connection with Project Andromeda could become insolvent or face other financial difficulties.  While there may be certain legal and regulatory protections in place, they may not fully protect against all losses.

### Operational Risks
Custodial and Prime Brokerage firms are subject to operational risks including, but not limited to, system failures, human error and physical and electronic security breaches.  Such events could interrupt their services, potentially resulting in financial loss to the Client.

### Regulatory Changes
Legal and regulatory changes can impact the willingness of Custodial and Prime Brokerage firms to conduct business with the Client and/or the Adviser, and may also impact the services provided by such firms.  These changes may limit the ability of the Adviser to implement the Client’s investment objectives with respect to the Account.

The Adviser does not guarantee the performance or services of the Custodial or the Prime Brokerage firms that hold the Account’s investments.

## Treasury Bill Risks
### Treasury Bill Interest Rate Risk
Treasury bills, like other fixed-income investments, are susceptible to interest rate fluctuations.  This is known as interest rate risk.  When interest rates rise, the prices of existing treasury bills on the secondary market typically fall, as newer issues come to market bearing higher coupon rates, making the older, lower-yielding T-bills less attractive.  Consequently, if the Account is forced to sell these treasury bills before maturity, it may realize a capital loss.  This risk is particularly acute for treasury bills due to their short-term nature, as they are more directly tied to the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate decisions.

In addition, if the Federal Reserve embarks on a period of tightening monetary policy (i.e., raising interest rates), the yield on newly issued treasury bills will increase.  However, if the Account holds onto older T-bills with lower yields, the overall return of the Account could lag behind the market.

Conversely, in a declining interest rate environment, while the market price of treasury bills already held in the account may rise, the yield on newly issued treasury bills would be lower.  This would mean that as treasury bills in the Account mature and the proceeds are reinvested, they would be invested at these lower yields, potentially reducing the income generated by the Account.

Thus, interest rate risk can affect both the market value of the treasury bills in the Account and the income generated by the Account.  This risk underscores the need for careful monitoring of changes in interest rates and may require adjustments to the Account's investment strategy based on interest rate trends.

### Treasury Bill Reinvestment Risk
Treasury Bill Reinvestment Risk pertains to the uncertainty surrounding the rate at which the proceeds from a maturing treasury bill can be reinvested.  Given the short-term nature of treasury bills (with maturities of 26 weeks or less in the Account’s case), the Account will face frequent instances of reinvestment.  If interest rates have fallen at the time of these reinvestments, the proceeds from the matured treasury bills will be reinvested at a lower yield, potentially reducing the overall return of the Account.  This is known as reinvestment risk.

For example, suppose the Account initially invests in treasury bills yielding 2%.  If at maturity, the rates have dropped to 1.5%, the proceeds from the matured treasury bills will be reinvested at this lower rate.  This could lower the income that the Account can generate, thereby impacting its overall return.

It’s worth noting that reinvestment risk is especially relevant in a falling interest rate environment.  Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, reinvestment risk is less of a concern as maturing treasury bills would be reinvested at higher rates, potentially increasing the income generated by the Account.

However, the degree of reinvestment risk depends on the broader economic climate, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, and other factors that influence interest rates.  Effective management of this risk requires close monitoring of economic conditions and potential adjustments to the investment strategy based on interest rate forecasts.

### Treasury Bill Inflation Risk
Treasury Bill Inflation Risk refers to the risk that the returns from the treasury bills may not keep up with inflation, resulting in a decrease in the real purchasing power of the income from these investments.  In other words, even if the investment in treasury bills is safe in nominal terms, the real value of the return could be eroded by inflation.
For instance, if the treasury bills are yielding a two percent (2%) return, but inflation is running at three percent (3%), the real return on the investment is effectively negative one percent (-1%).  Over time, this could lead to a significant reduction in purchasing power.  This is especially relevant when investing in low-yield securities like treasury bills, as their returns are more likely to be outpaced by inflation.
In periods of high inflation, the nominal returns on treasury bills may not be sufficient to maintain the purchasing power of the capital invested.  Therefore, even though the treasury bills are considered a low-risk investment, the inflation risk could lead to a loss in real terms.
The Client should be aware of inflation trends and consider the potential impact of inflation on the Account.  The Client may be required to periodically modify the Account’s investment guidelines in order to effectively manage this risk.
Treasury Bill Credit Risk.  Treasury Bill Credit Risk refers to the risk that the issuer of a security, in this case, the U.S. Government, will default on its obligation to repay principal or pay interest.  U.S. Treasury Bills are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which has historically made them one of the safest investments in terms of credit risk.
However, that does not mean they are entirely without credit risk.  In theory, severe financial or political crises could increase the risk of the U.S. government defaulting on its debt obligations.  For instance, during periods of political gridlock, the U.S. government has come close to a debt ceiling breach, which if not resolved could lead to a default scenario.
While the likelihood of such a default is extremely low, it is not zero.  In the event of a default, the value of U.S. Treasury Bills could decrease significantly, leading to potential losses for the Account.
Therefore, even though the credit risk associated with U.S. Treasury Bills is minimal, it is important to monitor the fiscal and political situation in the U.S. to assess any potential changes to this risk.  This includes keeping track of the U.S. government's credit rating, fiscal policies, and the political climate, especially around times of debt ceiling negotiations.
Treasury Bill Liquidity Risk.  Treasury Bill Liquidity Risk refers to the risk that the Account may not be able to quickly sell its holdings of Treasury Bills without suffering a loss in value.  Under normal market conditions, U.S. Treasury Bills are considered highly liquid due to their strong demand, standardized features, and the large, active market in which they trade.
However, in certain abnormal market conditions, such as during periods of significant financial distress or market dislocation, the liquidity of T-bills could diminish.  This could occur if a large number of investors simultaneously attempt to sell their holdings, causing supply to outstrip demand.  In such a scenario, the Account may be unable to sell its treasury bills without accepting a lower price, which could lead to losses.
It's also worth noting that while the liquidity of treasury bills is generally high, it can vary based on the specific maturity of the treasury bill.  For instance, treasury bills with less common maturities may be less liquid than those with more standard maturities.
Treasury Bill Market Risk.  Treasury Bill Market Risk refers to the risk that the value of the treasury bills could decrease due to changes in the broader market.  While treasury bills are less volatile than many other types of securities, they are not immune to market risk.  Various factors can influence the overall market, leading to fluctuations in the price and yield of treasury bills.
Economic indicators, such as changes in GDP growth, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, and business investment, can influence market perceptions about the future course of interest rates, which can in turn affect the value of treasury bills.
Moreover, geopolitical events, such as wars, terrorism, political instability, trade disputes, or unexpected election results, can create uncertainty in the market and can potentially affect the value of treasury bills.  Natural disasters or public health crises, which can have significant economic impacts, are also sources of market risk.
Treasury Bill Operational Risk.  Treasury Bill Operational Risk refers to the risk that potential losses may result from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events.  This includes a wide range of risks such as transactional errors, system failures, fraud, or any event that disrupts the normal functioning of the account.
For instance, errors in executing transactions, such as buying or selling the wrong quantity of treasury bills, could lead to financial losses.  Similarly, failures in the Account’s systems, such as issues with its trading platform or risk management software, could hinder its ability to effectively manage its treasury bill holdings.  Fraud, either internal or external, could also lead to losses.
External events that could lead to operational risk include natural disasters that disrupt the Account's operations, changes in laws or regulations that affect its ability to operate, or a significant event at a third-party service provider, such as a custodian or a broker, that impacts its ability to service the Account.
Operational risks can be managed through strong internal controls, regular audits, robust systems and procedures, disaster recovery planning, and diligent oversight of third-party service providers.  However, it's important to note that not all operational risks can be predicted or controlled, and there is always a degree of residual risk that must be accepted.
Treasury Bill Regulatory Risk.  Treasury Bill Regulatory Risk refers to the risk that changes in laws or regulations may affect the value, operation, or profitability of the treasury bills in the Account.  Regulatory changes can come from various sources, including Congress, government agencies, or regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Reserve.
For example, changes in tax laws could affect the after-tax returns from treasury bills.  Similarly, new regulations pertaining to the purchase, sale, or holding of treasury bills could impact the Account's ability to invest in these securities or could increase the costs associated with these investments.
Additionally, regulatory changes could affect the broader economic environment, which in turn could influence interest rates and the value of treasury bills.  For example, changes in banking regulations or monetary policy could affect market interest rates, which could then impact the yields on treasury bills.
Treasury Bill Counterparty Risk.  Counterparty risk refers to the risk that a party to a financial transaction will not fulfill their obligations.  For instance, when purchasing treasury bills, the counterparty is typically a broker or dealer.  If this entity fails to deliver the treasury bills after the Account has paid for them, this would be a form of counterparty risk.
Similarly, the Account will use a custodian to hold its treasury bills.  If the custodian faces financial or operational difficulties, it could affect the Account's ability to access its treasury bills.  This could be particularly damaging if the Account needs to sell its treasury bills quickly to make distributions or to take advantage of an investment opportunity.
While the counterparty risk associated with treasury bills is generally low due to the highly regulated and standardized nature of these transactions, it can increase in times of economic stress or market turmoil.  For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the failure of major financial institutions led to significant counterparty risk.
